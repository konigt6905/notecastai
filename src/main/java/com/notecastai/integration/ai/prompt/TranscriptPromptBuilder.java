            CRITICAL TTS-FRIENDLY TEXT RULES:
            1. Write ONLY spoken text - no labels, no speaker names, no stage directions
            2. Use natural, conversational language suitable for speaking aloud
            3. Keep sentences clear and medium-length (10-20 words ideal)
            4. Avoid special characters: no asterisks, brackets, parentheses in speech
            5. Write out numbers and abbreviations: "three" not "3", "doctor" not "Dr."
            6. Use simple punctuation: periods and commas only (avoid semicolons, dashes)
            7. Include natural pauses by ending sentences, not with "..."
            8. Avoid acronyms unless commonly spoken (NASA is ok, WCAG is not)
            9. No markdown, no formatting codes, no URLs
            10. No meta-commentary like "[pause]" or "(speaks softly)"
            11. Make it sound like one person speaking naturally to an audience
            12. Flow smoothly from one idea to the next with natural transitions

Over the next several minutes, we'll explore how this technology is reshaping the business landscape and why it's becoming essential for companies of all sizes. Let's begin with the fundamentals. Cloud computing means using remote servers hosted on the internet to store, manage, and process data, rather than relying on local servers or personal computers. This shift represents a fundamental change in how we think about IT infrastructure. The first major benefit is cost reduction. Traditional data centers require substantial capital investment. You need to purchase servers, networking equipment, and cooling systems. You need physical space to house everything. You need staff to maintain it all. These costs add up quickly, often reaching millions of dollars before you process a single transaction. Cloud computing eliminates most of these expenses. Instead of buying equipment, you rent computing resources from providers like Amazon, Microsoft, or Google. You pay only for what you actually use, typically on a monthly basis. This transforms IT from a capital expense into an operating expense, making it much easier to manage financially. The second advantage is scalability. Businesses are dynamic. You might have steady traffic most of the year, then experience massive spikes during holidays or special events. Traditional infrastructure requires you to build capacity for these peak times, leaving resources idle the rest of the year. Cloud services scale automatically. When demand increases, the system allocates more resources. When demand drops, it scales back down. You're always paying for exactly what you need, nothing more, nothing less."

Over the next fifteen minutes, we're going to take an in-depth look at this transformative technology, examining not just what it is, but how it works, why it matters, and how it's changing the way businesses operate in the digital age. So let's dive in. First, let's establish what we mean by cloud computing. At its core, cloud computing is the delivery of computing services over the internet. These services include servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence. Instead of owning and maintaining physical data centers and servers, companies access these resources from cloud providers on an as-needed basis. Think of it like electricity. You don't generate your own power. You don't maintain a power plant. You simply plug into the grid and pay for what you use. Cloud computing works the same way. Now, let's explore the economic transformation this enables. Traditional IT infrastructure requires massive capital investment. Imagine you're starting a new online business. Before cloud computing, you would need to estimate your maximum capacity, then purchase enough servers and equipment to handle that peak load. This meant spending hundreds of thousands or even millions of dollars upfront, before you had a single customer. You needed physical space to house the equipment. You needed specialized cooling systems to prevent overheating. You needed backup power systems. You needed security measures. And you needed skilled staff to manage everything around the clock. This high barrier to entry meant only well-funded companies could build robust online services. Cloud computing changes everything. Now you can start with minimal resources and pay only for what you use. Your first month might cost fifty dollars. As you grow, your costs increase proportionally, but so does your revenue. This pay-as-you-go model democratizes technology, allowing startups to compete with established players..."
